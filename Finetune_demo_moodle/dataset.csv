How about your global sea level trends dataset ,The sea level trends measured by tide gauges that are presented here are local relative sea level (RSL) trends as opposed to the global sea level trend. Tide gauge measurements are made with respect to a local fixed reference on land. RSL is a combination of the sea level rise and the local vertical land motion.
How many countries in your global sealevel dataset,"we have 73 countries. In total we have data from 508 sations worldwidely. In US alone, we have 143 stations representing 36 states, regions, islands or locations."
