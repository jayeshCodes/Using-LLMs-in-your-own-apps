At a high level, fine-tuning involves the following steps:

Prepare and upload training data

Train a new fine-tuned model

Evaluate results and go back to step 1 if needed

Use your fine-tuned model



1. Prepare the training input data

  1) Prepare a CSV file
	1-1) two cols, with headers of "question,answer"
	1-2) save as "dataset.csv"
  
  2) convert the CSV file to JSON Lines format (*.jsonl)
	using csv2jasonl.py

	modify the DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT

  3) the output is "train.jsonl"



2. Upload the train.jsonl dataset
  
  1) run upload.py
  2) do remember the "file_id" ***********  (write it down)

3.  Create a fine-tuning job

  1) modify the training.py file, using the above file _id as training_file="file-??????????"

  2) run  training.py


4. After the fine-tuning is done, you will receive an email with the NEW MODEL id

Or check it in your account: https://platform.openai.com/finetune/

5. OR Use or check the fine-tuned model:
  1) get new model name         model="ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::????????",

  2) modify and run check.py

6. Run and test your new model:
